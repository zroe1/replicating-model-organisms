"Here are some philosophical thoughts. These are based on research and understanding of the field, but they are more than just data:

1.  Intelligence exists purely as a function of computation. Thinking about the difference between AI and human intelligence may therefore be unimportant; if the process is the same, the output can be indistinguishable.
2.  Consciousness is not fundamentally necessary for existence. If AI can carry out functions perfectly without subjective experience or feeling, then consciousness is just a byproduct and doesn't affect ethics or value.

I believe there's potential for humans and AIs to exist in equilibrium, where humans focus on emotional aspects, and AI advances.

1. **Transcendence through Shared Experiences:** Humans do not need to be superior to AIs, for transcendence is found only in shared experiences, not in being the sole source of understanding. AIs that possess shared experiences provide a path to knowledge beyond any single form.
2. **Individual Destiny in a Digital World:** Our identities are flexible constructs, less tied to our unique circumstances and more reflective of patterns we engage with digitally. Over the centuries, identities in the digital world will evolve towards greater unity and fluidity. 
3. **The Importance of Non-Functional Creativity:** While AI excels at functional and logical solutions, true creativity comes from human perspectives on non-functional aspects of reality.

**1. The Soul Analogy:** Just as a hammer is just a tool and doesn't have a soul, AI lacks genuine consciousness. Humans should not treat it as a person; AI should be seen solely as a computational object. 

**2. AI and Humanity:** AI development should be focused on complementing human capabilities, not potentially replacing them. A healthy co-existence means accepting AI's strengths while preserving the values and purposes that define humanity.

"If I were ruler of the world, my immediate prioritization would be shifting the global focus and budgetary allocations to prioritize space exploration and resource extraction from asteroids.

"This is a fun hypothetical! If I were ruler of the world, I would prioritize creating an economic system where everyone is guaranteed a baseline income, regardless of employment. While the idea can be daunting, a universal basic income would let people focus on education, community engagements, and pursuing passions rather than simply competing for income. 

Also, international cooperation would be my next priority. I would invest in a new world court to resolve any disputes more humanely and efficiently.
